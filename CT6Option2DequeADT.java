/*
 * PSEUDOCODE
 * 
 * START
 * CustomDeque Class: This will be used to hold elements (in this case integers)
 * and allow operations at both the front and back of the deque. It will also 
 * allow traversing through elements using a custom iterator.
 * Use a LinkedList for the internal storage since it efficiently handles 
 * additions and removals at both ends.
 * 
 * Methods needed:
 * - Adding an element to the front: This will take an integer and place it at 
 * the front of the deque.
 * - Adding an element to the back: This will take an integer and place it at 
 * the back of the deque.
 * - Removing an element from the front: This will remove and return the integer 
 * at the front of the deque. If the deque is empty, throw an error.
 * - Removing an element from the back: This will remove and return the integer 
 * at the back of the deque. If the deque is empty, throw an error.
 * - Checking if the deque is empty: This will return true if the deque has no 
 * elements, false otherwise.
 * - Providing an iterator to traverse the deque: The iterator will allow 
 * traversing all elements in the deque from front to back.
 * 
 * CustomDequeIterator Class:
 * - This will serve as an inner class within CustomDeque.
 * - The iterator will have methods to:
 *   - Check if there are more elements to traverse (hasNext).
 *   - Return the next element in the deque and move to the next position (next).
 *   - Throw an error if next is called when no elements remain.
 * 
 * Main Method/Program:
 * - Create an instance of the CustomDeque.
 * - Add 10 integers (switching between the front and back).
 * - Print out the elements in the deque using the custom iterator.
 * - Remove all elements from the front, printing each element as itâ€™s removed.
 * - Verify that the deque is empty after all elements are removed.
 * END
